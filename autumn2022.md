    <p><strong>Title: &nbsp;</strong>On The Fermat's Last Theorem Modulo a Prime</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Speaker: &nbsp;</strong> Mr. Rajiv Mishra, PhD Student, IISER Kolkata
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
        <strong>Abstract: &nbsp;</strong> Fermat's "last theorem" states that for any natural number $n\geq 3$, the equation $x^n+y^n=z^n$ does not have any solution in the natural numbers. Schur tried to prove the Fermat's last theorem by showing that the equation $x^n+y^n=z^n$ does not have any solution if we do arithmetic modulo any prime. But he found that this is not true, in fact, for any natural number $n$, the equation $x^n+y^n=z^n(\text{mod }p)$ has a solution in natural numbers for any sufficiently large prime number $p$. We shall see how graph theoretic tools are used to solve this number theory problem.
