    <p><strong>Title: &nbsp;</strong>Classification of representation of $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{C})$</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Speaker: &nbsp;</strong> Mr. Jitender Sharma, PhD Student, IISER Kolkata
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
        <strong>Abstract: &nbsp;</strong> In this talk we will classify all the representation of $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{C})$. We will see that all the representation comes from the Lie group $SU(2)$, group of special unitary matrices of order $2$.

    <p><strong>Title: &nbsp;</strong>Biorthogonal family construction and its application to controllability</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Speaker: &nbsp;</strong> Mr. Manish Kumar, PhD Student, IISER Kolkata
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
        <strong>Abstract: &nbsp;</strong> We all know about the orthogonal family from our basic linear algebra course but have you heard of Biorthogonal family?
        The center of this talk will be to define it, and construct one such family for a particular family of complex exponential functions, along with its need to solve a moment problem and hence a control problem for a system.

<div id="FermatsTheorem">
    <p>22 August, 2022</p>
    <p><strong>Title: &nbsp;</strong>On The Fermat's Last Theorem Modulo a Prime</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Speaker: &nbsp;</strong> Mr. Rajiv Mishra, PhD Student, IISER Kolkata
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
        <strong>Abstract: &nbsp;</strong> Fermat's "last theorem" states that for any natural number $n\geq 3$, the equation $x^n+y^n=z^n$ does not have any solution in the natural numbers. Schur tried to prove the Fermat's last theorem by showing that the equation $x^n+y^n=z^n$ does not have any solution if we do arithmetic modulo any prime. But he found that this is not true, in fact, for any natural number $n$, the equation $x^n+y^n=z^n(\text{mod }p)$ has a solution in natural numbers for any sufficiently large prime number $p$. We shall see how graph theoretic tools are used to solve this number theory problem.
