    <p><strong>Title: &nbsp;</strong>Two Theorems on Elliptic Curves</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Speaker: &nbsp;</strong> Mr. Sayan Dutta, 4th Year BS-MS, IISER Kolkata
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
        <strong>Abstract: &nbsp;</strong>  This will be the second lecture in the mini course on Number Theory and Elliptic curves. We will be discussing the geometry of elliptic curves, and the proofs of the Nagell Lutz Theorem and Mordellâ€™s Theorem. The talk mostly features elementary concepts that only require a surface level idea of group theory for appreciation.
