    <p><strong>Title: &nbsp;</strong>Variational Inference: Ideas and Advancements</p>

        <strong>Abstract: &nbsp;</strong>  Intractable posteriors are a common hurdle in Bayesian inference and Probabilistic Machine Learning. Although MCMC methods are widely used to tackle this, they are notoriously slow. Variational inference is a technique which helps us circumvent this problem. I will introduce the problem of intractable posteriors, discuss the core idea of variational inference, optimization of the ELBO and the developments in this technique which make it more powerful and scalable.
