    <p><strong>Title: &nbsp;</strong>Two Theorems on Elliptic Curves</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Speaker: &nbsp;</strong> Mr. Sayan Dutta, 4th Year BS-MS, IISER Kolkata
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
        <strong>Abstract: &nbsp;</strong>  Elliptic curves form a major part of recent advancements in various fields of Number Theory. We will be discussing the geometry of elliptic curves, and the proofs of the Nagell Lutz Theorem and Mordellâ€™s Theorem. The talk is quite elementary in flavour and only requires a surface level idea of groups and rings for appreciation.
